# `Frontend webpage for Cloudflare internship general assignment "AstroMedia" üî≠ü™ê‚ú®üåå`

This is my submission for the frontend section of the Cloudflare internship [`general assignment`](https://apply.cloudflareworkers.com/)

I call my website "AstroMedia" because it is intended to host cool and interesting astronomy/cosmology photos. I love astronomy so I thought this would be the most interesting way to demonstrate the working product.

It is written with ReactJS, created with [`Create React App`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This frontend connects with my Worker backend to retrieve all the posts. Images are hosted on cloudinary using their React SDK.

You can browse all posts at the home page or click on a post to see all posts by that one user.

There is a "new post" button at the top right that allows you to create a new post by adding a title, caption/content, username, as well as an optional image. If you're reading this then please feel free to add a post/image!

While designing the website I made sure everything worked on mobile as well, since social media is extremely popular on mobile, so please don't be afraid to pull it up on your phone to see how everything looks.

I will admit that this was my first time using JavaScript/React/HTML/CSS extensively so there are bound to be obvious mistakes but I did my best to make everything as optimized as possible.

Thank you!
